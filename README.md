## Program 4
Run `sudo install-libgd.sh` to install libgd     
Compile with `cc program.c -lgd -fopenmp`     
Pass input and output file names as args. Eg: `./a.out car.png static.png`     
You have to recompile whenever you change schedule type. Taking it as input makes the code ugly so I'm not gonna do it.
